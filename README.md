# Ela-Murgelj
# This is me and my work!✧.*

**Frontend Engineer × ML Engineer**  
I build clean, fast interfaces and ship models that actually make products smarter. My work often blends UX instincts with data-driven systems—especially around fashion trend prediction and recommender flows.

## What I’m good at

**Frontend**
- React / Next.js · TypeScript · Tailwind · Recharts
- State & data layers (React Query, context patterns)
- Design systems, accessibility, responsive layouts, perf budgets

**ML & Data**
- Python · PyTorch/TensorFlow · scikit-learn
- Time-series (LSTM/ARIMA), embeddings, retrieval & evaluation
- Data pipelines, feature engineering, experiment tracking

**Ops & Tools**
- Git, GitHub Actions, Docker
- Testing: Vitest/Jest, React Testing Library
- Fast prototyping with Jupyter + Notebooks-as-Reports

## Selected Work

### Swipe-To-Style (MVP)
A swipe interface for style inspiration that turns 20 swipes into concrete product matches.  
- **Frontend**: React Native + Tailwind, gesture-driven UX, cached image pipelines  
- **ML**: similarity search over visual embeddings, reranking with user feedback  
- **Why it matters**: showcases full-stack product sense: UX + ML that improves with interaction.

### Trend Forecasting: LSTM vs. ARIMA
Research comparing deep learning vs. statistical baselines to predict **trend saturation**.  
- **Stack**: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Pandas; data from Google Trends, weather, social  
- **Highlights**: feature engineering for seasonality, lead-time analysis, robust evaluation  
- **Outcome**: clear guidance on when ML outperforms classical methods—and when it doesn’t.

### Frontend Analytics Dashboard
A modular dashboard template with cards, filters, and charts ready for real data.  
- **Stack**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Recharts  
- **Focus**: clean components, accessible keyboard nav, test coverage, and perf budgets.

## How I work
- Start from the user journey → define contracts between UI and data early.  
- Prefer small, measurable experiments over “big bang” features.  
- Ship with logs, metrics, and tests so iteration is cheap.

---

## Currently
- Hardening a light-weight recsys pipeline for fashion data.  
- Exploring model evaluation UIs that help non-ML teammates reason about tradeoffs.
